This is a brief, friendly, and (hopefully) useful introduction to Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). I decided to write a post about GNNs because of their growing prevalance in data science problems that require a global (such as topological) structure of the data. Understanding your data is paramount to good data science, so improving on our upstream pre-processing and analysis of data before processing them through models is really important and impactful.

In this post we will be following _"Graph Representation Learning"_ by William L. Hamilton and some simple code that I wrote based on [INSERT HERE] after we get some theory down.

## Prereqs

To understands GNNs, I highly recommend having a foundation in the following:
- Graph Theory
- Machine Learning
- Feedforward Neural Networks
- Convolutional Neural Networks (optional, but recommended)

# Introduction

First let's introduce what **representation learning** is, as this is a largely useful application of GNNs in practice.

## Representation Learning

**Representation learning** is the process of automatically discovering useful representations (or features) of data so that downstream tasks (like classification, regression, or clustering) become easier.

Examples:
- In images, pixels are low-level representations. We may prefer edges, textures, or object parts/patterns - these are learned representations (In fact, CNNs do this in the hidden layers!).
- In graphs, raw adjacency lists are hard to work with. A good learned representation might capture a node's communinity, role, or connectivity patterns.

### Why is Representation Learning Important?

#### 1. Feature Engineering Bottleneck:
- Before deep learning, machine learning relied more heavily on manually designed features (e.g., SIFT for images and bag-of-words for text). Representation learning automates feature engineering.
#### 2. Generalization & Transfer
- Good representations transfer to other tasks.
#### 3. Non-Euclidean or Structured Data
- For graphs, molecules, or time series, representation learning helps find an embedding in a more tractable space.

### How is it Different from ML?

In traditional ML, like SVMs, decision trees, or linear regression, we assume the input features are already meaningful.

Representaiton learning is about _learning the features themselves_.

### Use Cases

To motivate representation learning, here are some use cases in data science:
- **Computer Vision** - CNNs learn hierarchical representations
  - Lower layers typically learn edges and textures
  - Middle layers will learn more complicated patterns like object parts
  - Higher layers learn even more complicated patterns like entire objects
- **Natural Language Processing** - Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT)
  - Words are mapped to dense vectors that capture semantic meaning.
- **Graph Data** â€“ GNNs
  - GNNs learn representations of nodes/edges/entire graphs that encode structural and feature information.
