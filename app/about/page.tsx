        About Me
      </h1>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Thank you for visiting my personal website.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        I’m a graduate student at Montana State University pursuing an M.S. in Cybersecurity.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Previously, I earned a B.S. in Mathematics and Computer Science from the Georgia Institute of Technology, where I concentrated in Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Information Interworks.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        My academic foundation is rooted in mathematics, statistics, and data science. I’m now building upon that to explore and contribute to the world of cybersecurity—especially in areas like vulnerability analysis, adversarial machine learning, and anomaly detection.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        This site is a reflection of my interests and explorations. Here, you’ll find technical deep dives, conceptual essays, and thoughts on topics at the intersection of systems, security, machine learning, and society.

      <p className="mb-4">
        I train in CrossFit, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Muay Thai, and climbing. I’m passionate about the outdoors, fitness, and adventure whether that’s mountain biking, surfing, or snowboarding.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        This site is sort of my public notebook: expect commentary on science and tech, essays on society and philosophy, and the occasional deep dive into tools, trends, and ideas shaping the world.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        I hope you find some of the content useful and interesting. Feel free to contact me if you want to talk for whatever reason.
